# Retail data analysis

This report was my first assignment on my MSc Big Data course where we were tasked with producing a data analysis of customer and sales data for a large clothing retailer in the US.

Having only learned Python in the 6 weeks preceeding this assignment, this was a challenge where I learned a lot for future data projects.

I recieved a Distinction for this assignment.
